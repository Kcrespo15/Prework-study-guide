## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes for HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. If students are unsure of what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. Options of what to study will then be presented to students and they can choose what topic they are interested in learning first. Boot camp students can alaways double back on these notes if they are ever unsure on certain topic matters or if they need a reference on how to apply certain code.
